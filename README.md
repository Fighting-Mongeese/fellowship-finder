# Fellowship Finder

Fellowship Finder is a web app that allows users to find and meet people with similar interests in games.

The app allows users to create profiles, filter through other users based on interests and meetup logistics, add friends, and plan events. Fellowship Finder is meant to provide a platform for people to make friends with shared interests and streamline the process of organizing tabletop sessions.
